summary: "Despite popular misbelief, stainless steel can rust, and so will your stainless steel railing if not maintained. How prone a stainless steel railing is to rust depends on several factors, such as the environment it is in and the steel’s chemical composition.Chromium is the primary alloying element that turns carbon steel into stainless steel. It creates a layer of chromium oxide that essentially seals the iron. This process prevents the iron from reacting with the environment. As a result, the metal doesn’t rust and remains shiny and lustrous.However, environmental factors and exposure to acidic substances can damage the chromium oxide layer. Salt, chlorine, and neglecting cleaning and maintenance speed up this destructive process."
