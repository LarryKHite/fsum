summary: "A missing or broken spindle on a staircase is less than ideal, not only does it look unsightly, but it’s also dangerous especially if you have small kids or pets that might fall through a gap. Or, if your stairs are looking a little tired then replacing the spindles, or entire balustrade, followed by a lick of paint is an awesome way to freshen them up! It sounds super tricky to replace them, but it doesn’t have to be and this is how you can get your stairs looking chic again ASAP."
